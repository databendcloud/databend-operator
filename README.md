[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. [Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop.

Use this operator to manage [Databend](https://github.com/databendlabs/databend) clusters which are deployed as custom resources. In short, the task of configuring, creating, managing, automatically scaling up and scaling-in of Databend cluster(s) in a Kubernetes environment has been made simple, easy and quick.
